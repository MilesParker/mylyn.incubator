				History
				<ul>
					<li>2005-11-25: Initial draft (Brock Janiczak and Mik 
					Kersten) </li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>General</b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Associate a repository with a project, credentials 
					stored in keyring. UI is a project properties page specified 
					by provider. 
					</li>
					<li>Possibly provide view showing all repositories, where 
					each provider can populate repository nodes with contets 
					(e.g. products, reports). 
					</li>
					<li>Should be able to discover new repositories by checking 
					out a project. 
					<ul>
						<li>Mik: Brock, could you provide more detail on this 
						one? </li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">Consider the case of a user 
						that is new to a project.&nbsp; It would be really nice if 
						all they had to do was check out a project from CVS/SVN 
						and the tracker instance is created and associated with 
						the project automatically.&nbsp; I was expecting to store 
						this information as a project scoped preference (so it 
						can be checked in to version control).&nbsp; Another option 
						is to have a a file (like the team PSF file) that can be 
						imported to create the required tracker instances and 
						attempt to connect each project to its appropriate 
						instance.</font> </li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">Also, most issue trackers have 
						some way to partition bugs into groups (that can relate 
						to a project atrifact).&nbsp; It would be nice if this could 
						also be associated with the project so when an issue is 
						created in the context of a project the component (or 
						whatever your tracker calls it) can be defaulted.</font> 
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>&nbsp;</li>
					<li>No coupling to mylar core or UI. </li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Queries</b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide a general notion of a query and parameters, hits 
					returned, and a persistance mechanism (a first cut at this 
					is already in mylar.tasklist). 
					</li>
					<li>Provide incoming/outgoing status notification. </li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Editing Reports</b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Basic mode of embedding browser when opening issue. 
					</li>
					<li>Generic issue editor similar to Mylar's Bugzilla one, 
					based on attributes and comments. </li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Text</b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hyperlink issue number in text editors. 
					<ul>
						<li>Brock: Berhaps we could have Team support for this? 
						SVN could store the info in properties and CVS in a 
						file. 
						</li>
						<li>Mik: isn't it enough just to look up the repository 
						associated with the project? </li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">It is possible to open a 
						resource directly from the history view or the 
						repository view.&nbsp; In these cases there is no project.</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Source Repositories</b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide hyperlink support in the history view 
					<ul>
						<li>Mik: This may be better as a popup action, which 
						Mylar already has. But hyperlink could work as well. 
						</li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">A popup action is fine when 
						there is only one bug referenced in the commit comment, 
						but some people (like myself) sometimes check in a 
						change that relates to multiple issues.&nbsp; I probably 
						shouldn't, but i do :)</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Populate commit comment with issue details. 
					<ul>
						<li>Brock: (Possible use the new template stuff? Ie a 
						dynamic template) 
						</li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">Just clarifying this as it 
						makes no sense at all...&nbsp; In 3.2 CVS supports static 
						templates.&nbsp; The user just creates a chunk of text and it 
						can be added into the commit dialog.&nbsp; I can't see why 
						this template support can't be updated to support 
						'active' templates.&nbsp; You select a 'bug' template and a 
						dialog pops up asking you to enter (or search for) a 
						bug.&nbsp; These values will then be inserted into the 
						template before it is added to the commit dialog.&nbsp; I 
						think this would be of more value than the current 
						static templates.&nbsp; I would be willing to look at 
						providing a patch to Team/CVS for this one.&nbsp; btw, I will 
						try and convince them to push it down to the Team level 
						so the same templates can be used for all team providers 
						(it seems to make sense).</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Perform some sort of Issue workflow action on commit 
					(probably resolve) 
					<ul>
						<li>Brock: CVS has no support for any of this yet. They 
						would probably accept patches for most of this. If some 
						of this could be moved to Team, even better. All 
						repositories have a commit process and all have a 
						revision history. 
						</li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">again, what was I on?&nbsp; I 
						basically wanted a post commit hook so we could perform 
						an action against the issue tracker.&nbsp; The obvious thing 
						to do is comment/resolve an issue.&nbsp; Perhaps i was asking 
						for a team level commit dialog???</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Mylar</b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>What are the requirements for Mylar? 
					<ul>
						<li>Brock: It really only needs to get a list of issue 
						from a query. The query implementation and UI need to be 
						provider specific unless the query is always &quot;my bugs&quot;. 
						I don't see a problem with adding a Mylar/Issue Tracker 
						bridge to do this. 
						</li>
						<li>Mik: The main thing Mylar needs is for there to be a 
						single high quality Tasks view that makes it easy to 
						work with local tasks, reports, and queries, and for 
						that to be consisntent across providers. What it layers 
						on to that is the ability to activate contexts. It also 
						needs a mechanism for attaching context to issues, and 
						retrieving them from issues. From a source and feature 
						perspective the task functionality should be decoupled 
						from Mylar (and it is, i.e. you can use the Mylar Tasks 
						view and Bugzilla support without the Mylar UI). But 
						Mylar is all about a very task-centric view of the 
						world, and as such the UIs will be highly 
						interdependent. </li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">I am not sure how to support 
						local issues yet.&nbsp; It is almost as if we need another 
						view to show local issues (the platform task view would 
						be perfect)</font><br>
&nbsp;</li>
						<li><font color="#6600cc">I have been thinking about the 
						best way to structure the UI.&nbsp; The issue tracker as it 
						currently stands is no good.&nbsp; I was considering having 
						two separate views; A &quot;Repository browser&quot; and an issue 
						list.&nbsp; The common navigator stuff that is coming for 3.2 
						would be perfect for the repository browser.&nbsp; We could 
						have a top level (project level) item for the issue 
						trackers as well as a node in each project that has an 
						attached provider.&nbsp; This seems to be a more logical 
						thing to do and puts the issue information right where 
						the user needs it.</font></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Use Cases</b> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Work with bugs and queries within Eclipse. 
					</li>
					<li>Work with Mylar's task contexts (layers on above). </li>
					<li><font color="#6600cc">As a user, one thing i would 
					*love* is to have a list of active searches.&nbsp; These will 
					update every so often and let me know when there are new 
					matches (or changes).&nbsp; This way i don't have to be 
					distracted by emails.&nbsp; Being able to switch between a set of 
					issues without re-running the query would also be nice.</font></li>
