<h4 align="center">Using Interaction History to Determine Interesting 
Information <br>
in a Development Environment </h4>
<P>
Thank you for downloading the preview release of Mylar. As you work Mylar will 
monitor your interaction with Eclipse (by logging IDs of: views, editors, 
commands, and preference changes along with their values). The log also stores 
information about the program elements that you edit and navigate, but removes 
identifying information about those elements by obfuscating their names and 
paths. Approximately once every week you will be asked to confirm an upload of 
this interaction log to a UBC server. Before uploading you will have a chance to 
review the information being sent, and to answer a short questionnaire. You will 
have the option to remain anonymous throughout the study.</P>

<font color="#999999">Details: The UBC Study title is Using Interaction History 
to Determine Interesting Information in a Development Environment. There are no 
known risks associated with this study. After the study, this interaction 
history will be stripped of all information identifying non-anonymous subjects, 
and we will use this data to determine what Mylar views are useful, and to 
determine whether Mylar makes it easier to work on large systems in Eclipse. We 
also plan on making this anonymous usage data available to other researchers 
interested in improving the IDE user experience. Please note that the data 
collected will be archived for future use. This data will be anonymous and not 
contain any identification information. This study is being conducted by Mik 
Kersten (beatmik@cs.ubc.ca) as a part of his PhD Thesis and supervised by Dr. 
Gail Murphy (murphy@cs.ubc.ca). If you have any questions about the data being 
collected or about the study in general please email us or call Mik Kersten at 
604-822-0193. If you have any concerns about your treatment or rights as a 
research subject, you may contact Research Subject Information Line in the UBC 
Office of Research Services at the University of British Columbia, at 
604-822-8598. If this questionnaire is completed it will be assumed that consent 
has been given. This study is being funded by the IBM Centre for Advanced 
Studies and by NSERC.
